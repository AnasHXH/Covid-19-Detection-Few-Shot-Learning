# Covid-19-Detection
This repository is implementation of Covid-Classification models using deep learning approaches. Paper Link(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349008732_COVID-19_detection_from_scarce_chest_X-Ray_image_data_using_few-shot_deep_learning_approach)

We have used following approaches for our experiments.
1. Logistic Regression (Baseline)
2. Convolutional Neural Networks.
3. Transfer Learning.
4. Siamese Networks (Few-Shot Learning)
5. Unsupervised learning (TSNE+PCA)
