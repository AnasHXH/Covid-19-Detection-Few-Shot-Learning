# Covid-19-Detection
This repository is implementation of Covid-Classification models using deep learning approaches. [Paper Link] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06285)

We have used following approaches for our experiments.
1. Logistic Regression (Baseline)
2. Convolutional Neural Networks.
3. Transfer Learning.
4. Siamese Networks (Few-Shot Learning)
5. Unsupervised learning (TSNE+PCA)
